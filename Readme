üìù Project Description:
Title:
Student Feedback Prediction Using Machine Learning (XGBoost Classifier)

Introduction:
The goal of this project is to predict the feedback (Good, Average, or Poor) that a student will receive based on their academic performance. We use Machine Learning (ML), specifically the Random Forest Classifier, to create a model that can classify students' feedback using features like attendance, assignment scores, test results, project scores, and participation.

Problem Statement:
In educational institutions, gathering student feedback is crucial for improving teaching quality and overall performance. However, manually predicting feedback for each student can be time-consuming and inconsistent. This project aims to automate and standardize this process using data-driven machine learning techniques.

Objective:To predict a student's feedback category based on their academic performance using a Random Forest Classifier, which is an ensemble learning technique.

Dataset:

The dataset consists of 5 key features:
Attendance (%): The percentage of classes attended by the student.
Assignment Score: The score achieved in assignments.
Test Score: The score from examinations.
Participation: A binary value (1 for active participation, 0 for lack of participation).
Project Score: The score for the final project or practical evaluation.
The target variable (Feedback) is categorical and has three classes: Good, Average, and Poor.

Methodology:
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is cleaned and prepared for training.
The categorical target variable is encoded using LabelEncoder.

Model Building:

We split the dataset into training and testing sets.
A Random Forest Classifier is used to train the model on the training set.

Model Evaluation:

We evaluate the model‚Äôs performance using accuracy and a classification report, which shows precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Prediction:

After training, the model can be used to predict feedback based on new student data (e.g., attendance, assignment scores).

Results:

The trained model predicts the feedback with a high level of accuracy, based on the evaluation on the test dataset. This prediction can then be used for educational decision-making or further analysis.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in automating the process of predicting student feedback. The Random Forest Classifier provides an efficient and accurate model, which can be used to provide early insights into student performance and help improve learning outcomes.
